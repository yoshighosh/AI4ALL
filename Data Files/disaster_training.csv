With the help of the American Red Cross, Mr. Fernando and his family are using a compost bin to help remove from the streets household garbage that blocks drains and causes flooding. Continuing, he said the United Nations and its partners were also pursuing ways to promote water harvesting and implement modernized irrigation facilities so communities in the region were not totally dependent on rainwater to keep crops alive during dry spells. It may be mentioned here that long range forecasts of the Indian southwest monsoon rainfall are generated by many other national and global centres which employ different prediction techniques. The availability of feed from grain and crop residues has also fallen sharply due to the drop in agricultural production, especially in rainfed areas. Last year, hundreds of people died in several avalanches following record snowfalls. The northern and eastern parts of the country received less rain in the past northeastern monsoon and expect inter monsoonal showers these days.

Thailand: The Bureau of Epidemiology is investigating dengue hemorrhagic fever cases in Phuket following increased case reports. Setting up the working groups is expected to be a drawn out affair and will not be helped by the complicated and contentious nature of some of the topics to be covered - legal and constitutional reforms, the bias of both state institutions and the media towards the ruling party - and the limited technical capacity of RENAMO to participate in them. The initial interventions - which many agencies engaged in on a larger scale than previously - were 'cash for work', where beneficiaries were paid for basic work which varied from desalinating farm land and clearing rubble to rebuilding houses and burying bodies. Ground water and river water -- the main drinking water sources in the camps -- have also been contaminated by sewage and silt washed into rivers has clogged up water filtration systems. The storm has been fearsome but there is light in the darkness: thanks to the concerted action of government, the media, charities and the local people, countless human lives have been saved from the wrath of this cyclone. Many receive cooked meals from TRO and several receive food from public donations which is then cooked at the camp. Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief assistance of the United Nations, including special economic assistance: special economic assistance to individual countries or regions. The surprising development is being engineered by a Somali-American technocrat intent on ending his native country's reputation as a failed state. The ShelterBox Response Team (SRT) on the ground in Nigeria has been working with Rotary in the flood stricken country, whilst awaiting the arrival of the first consignment of boxes. WHO is also ensuring access to essential health care to all those affected by the tragedy and helping to coordinate medical supplies to ensure that supply chains are working and that medicines are reaching where they are needed. These activities have involved the formation of farmers groups interested in collectively irrigating their lands, the provision of small, hand and engine driven pumps on credit to farmers and the training of the same farmers in maintenance of these pumps. Sudan believed in legal pluralism, and warned against attempts to impose a single legal culture reflecting one civilian that controlled others through imperialism and the imposition of force. The rains, which broke 30 year records in Mombassa, caused floods, landslides, washed away bridges and houses, damaged roads and disrupted water supplies. Risk of outbreaks is particularly acute in Ampara and Kalmunai, due to inadequate sanitation facilities (1,000 people reportedly have access to just three latrines). As a result of these inter-related causes, a number of vital social service provision sectors are unable to cope. These are some of the most impoverished communities and they will need a lot of help to rebuild their livelihoods and start earning some money for food.""",1
