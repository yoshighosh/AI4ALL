It is a lesson that Padang learnt in 2009 when a relatively moderate quake struck off Sumatra's west coast. Whole villages have been destroyed and winter crops have failed in the unseasonably cold weather. Some 38 of the country's 64 districts in the north, centre and east have been at least partly submerged by one of the worst floods in years, caused by snow melt and heavy monsoon downpours in north and east India. Reports indicate that over 27 million people from 25 districts were affected by the severe cyclonic storms. Most of the deaths were caused by the tidal wave which engulfed coastal villages, or by flying debris and falling trees that crushed flimsy bamboo and tin homes -- the best that most people in the country can afford.

Central and southern Vietnam are regularly pounded by tropical storms and resultant flooding.

Water and pasture shortages have resulted in livestock migration to areas that received better rainfall such as Gode and Ferfer woredas. It is caused by a potent toxin found in a common bacteria, and people generally contract it when their wounds come in contact with contaminated soil.
