Some opposition leaders continued with their abrasive manners and asperity, whereas some members of the ruling party also showed intolerance to the dissent and were averse to take along the opposition members, as they wished to take all the credit for relief and reconstruction.

The delay in the advance of monsoon over the northeast and its stagnation along the west coast after 8 June had been primarily due to the interference of high latitude circulation features with the monsoonal flow.
